Eats your text files and routes Jack connections for you.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
JACK development libraries

COMPILE:
From within autocable's directory,
$ make

OPERATION:
Start jackd

$ echo "system:capture_1 system:playback_1
> system:capture_2 system:playback_2" | ./autocable

or

$ ./autocable yourdirectory/textfile.ac

autocable will read any text file or piped input, however it
must be formatted properly.

In your file, use full port names and return each connection.
It does not matter if you return the last port connection.
ie.     	
	system:capture_1 system:playback_1
    	system:capture_2 system:playback_2

An example file 'session.ac' is included with this program.
