Eats your text files and routes Jack connections for you.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
JACK development libraries

COMPILE:
From within autocable's directory,
$ make

OPERATION:
Start jackd

$ echo "connect system:capture_1 system:playback_1
> disconnect system:capture_2 system:playback_2" | ./autocable

or

$ ./autocable yourdirectory/textfile.ac

autocable will read any text file or piped input, however it
must be formatted properly.

In your file, use disconnect/connect, full port names, and return each connection.
It does not matter if you return the last port connection.
ie.     	
	connect system:capture_1 system:playback_1
    	disconnect system:capture_2 system:playback_2

An example file 'session.ac' is included with this program.
